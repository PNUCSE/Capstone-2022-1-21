## 프로젝트 명: New Interactive Visualization System For Long Genome Sequences
## 목적: The goal of this project is to implement a web platform that provides a user-friendly interface to users wishing to study different genome data without the need to manually run specific programs by themselves, so that even users without the knowledge of how to run terminal commands and install various packages that might be needed for the program execution could compare and analyze genome data.
