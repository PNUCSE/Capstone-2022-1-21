## 프로젝트 명: 
New Interactive Visualization System For Long Genome Sequences

## 개요:
<p align="justify"> In essence, this project is intent on developing a web application that provides a user with the possibility to study genome data so as to disencumber them of the necessity to go through the many steps of genome alignment that includes dealing with the command line terminal, installing various packages and libraries needed for the execution of programs that align and compare genomes, and setting up the file system and programming environment. To implement such an application, various tools like JavaScript, Ajax, HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, as well as some other server related tools, were utilized. Using PHP, not only was it possible to run terminal commands needed for the execution of alignment algorithms externally but also connect the website with the MySQL database to optimize some processes running on the website and save the data that was uploaded on the website, as well as the data that was obtained as a result of the genome data processing and genome alignment. </p>

## 목적: 
<p align="justify"> The goal of this project is to implement a web platform that provides a user-friendly interface to users wishing to study different genome data without the need to manually run specific programs by themselves, so that even users without the knowledge of how to run terminal commands and install various packages that might be needed for the program execution could compare and analyze genome data. To do so, the programs were abstracted from the user interface, and only the file(s) provided by user is needed to produce an alignment file; hence, an upload function is sought for. In the process of developing a genome data visualization system, gathering information related to the field of comparative genomics and consequent comprehension and analysis of that very information is necessary and set as one of the goals for this project. As a result of this graduation project, it is wanted that a complete working product is built and utilized in real life. Finally, working on this project is thought to help gain experience of making a project in a collaborative environment. </p>
